# What does the distribution of petal lengths look like?

sns.distplot(iris.petal_length)

'''The distribution of petal lengths appears to be bimodal. There might be a need to further investigate by saperating the flowers into their own groups.'''

# Is there a correlation between petal length and petal width?

plt.figure(figsize=(16,9))
sns.regplot(x='petal_length', y='petal_width', data=iris)

'''The scatter plot shows two distinct groups, and that there is a positive correlation between petal length and petal width.'''

#Would it be reasonable to predict species based on sepal width and sepal length? Which features would be best used to predict species?

sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species')

'''Using a pair plot, with hue seperation applied to the different flower species, we can see that sepal length and sepal width has a clear distinction between setosa and vericolor/virinica. However, the later two are fairly entangled, and would present issue trying to parse them just from those features. If, however, we look at the petal width and petal length features, we can start to see clear patterns emerge based on species.'''

#Using the lesson as an example, use seaborn's load_dataset function to load the anscombe data set. Use pandas to group the data by the dataset column, and calculate summary statistics for each dataset. What do you notice?

#Plot the x and y values from the anscombe data. Each dataset should be in a separate column.
